@ARTICLE{Friedman2001-vj,
  title     = "Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine",
  author    = "Friedman, Jerome H",
  abstract  = "[Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the
               perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather
               than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise
               additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general
               gradient descent ``boosting'' paradigm is developed for additive
               expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms
               are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and
               Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic
               likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived
               for the particular case where the individual additive components
               are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such
               ``TreeBoost'' models are presented. Gradient boosting of
               regression trees produces competitive, highly robust,
               interpretable procedures for both regression and classification,
               especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.
               Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of
               Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are
               discussed.]",

  title    = "Multiple additive regression trees with application in
              epidemiology",
  author   = "Friedman, Jerome H and Meulman, Jacqueline J",
  abstract = "Predicting future outcomes based on knowledge obtained from past
              observational data is a common application in a wide variety of
              areas of scientific research. In the present paper, prediction
              will be focused on various grades of cervical preneoplasia and
              neoplasia. Statistical tools used for prediction should of course
              possess predictive accuracy, and preferably meet secondary
              requirements such as speed, ease of use, and interpretability of
              the resulting predictive model. A new automated procedure based
              on an extension (called 'boosting') of regression and
              classification tree (CART) models is described. The resulting
              tool is a fast 'off-the-shelf' procedure for classification and
              regression that is competitive in accuracy with more customized
              approaches, while being fairly automatic to use (little tuning),
              and highly robust especially when applied to less than clean
              data. Additional tools are presented for interpreting and
              visualizing the results of such multiple additive regression tree
              (MART) models.",
